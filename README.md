## Featured Projects

### GOAP AI  
[github.com/TaaroBravo/goap-ai](https://github.com/TaaroBravo/goap-ai)  
AI Dungeon Simulation using Goal-Oriented Action Planning in Unity (C#).  
Implements a complete GOAP system with zones, enemies, collectables, and dynamic multi-goal planning.  
Originally an academic project showing deep understanding of AI decision-making.

### Unity Weapon Strategy System  
[github.com/TaaroBravo/unity-weapon-strategy-system](https://github.com/TaaroBravo/unity-weapon-strategy-system)  
A modular weapon architecture built with the Strategy Pattern, inspired by Twisted Metal.  
Demonstrates extensible design where new weapons can be added without modifying existing code.

### Semantic Audio Search  
[github.com/TaaroBravo/semantic-audio-search](https://github.com/TaaroBravo/semantic-audio-search)  
Self-hosted semantic search engine for audio using CLAP, FastAPI, and Qdrant.  
Allows searching by concept (“ambient rain sound”) rather than filenames.

### E-commerce Microservices  
[github.com/TaaroBravo/ecommerce](https://github.com/TaaroBravo/ecommerce)  
Enterprise-level microservices architecture built with Spring Boot, Kafka, MongoDB, and Prometheus.  
Focuses on scalability, observability, and secure authentication with Keycloak.
